# Cubing At Home Discord Bot

This is the custom bot created for the CubingUSA Cubing@Home [Discord server](https://discord.gg/g4v8DrVXWD).

## Acknowledgement

This repo depends largely on the contributions and work of others, particularly those who have established the groundwork for standardized Rubik's cube scrambling. Although difficult to acknowledge all, the majority of the code from `/utils/scrambling` is from https://github.com/euphwes/pyTwistyScrambler, modified for this project. In turn, the majority of that code is from https://github.com/cs0x7f/cstimer. Each of those projects also borrow a lot of code from others, and are usually linked in the files themselves.
